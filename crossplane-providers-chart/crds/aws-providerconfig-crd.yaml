                description: |-
                  Endpoint is where you can override the default endpoint configuration
                  of AWS calls made by the provider.
                properties:
                  hostnameImmutable:
                    description: |-
                      Specifies if the endpoint's hostname can be modified by the SDK's API
                      client.


                      If the hostname is mutable the SDK API clients may modify any part of
                      the hostname based on the requirements of the API, (e.g. adding, or
                      removing content in the hostname). Such as, Amazon S3 API client
                      prefixing "bucketname" to the hostname, or changing the
                      hostname service name component from "s3." to "s3-accesspoint.dualstack."
                      for the dualstack endpoint of an S3 Accesspoint resource.


                      Care should be taken when providing a custom endpoint for an API. If the
                      endpoint hostname is mutable, and the client cannot modify the endpoint
                      correctly, the operation call will most likely fail, or have undefined
                      behavior.


                      If hostname is immutable, the SDK API clients will not modify the
                      hostname of the URL. This may cause the API client not to function
                      correctly if the API requires the operation specific hostname values
                      to be used by the client.


                      This flag does not modify the API client's behavior if this endpoint
                      will be used instead of Endpoint Discovery, or if the endpoint will be
                      used to perform Endpoint Discovery. That behavior is configured via the
                      API Client's Options.
                      Note that this is effective only for resources that use AWS SDK v2.
